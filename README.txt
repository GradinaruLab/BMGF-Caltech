This repository contains a script for processing data about potential 
contraceptive targets from Open Targets and CITDBase and retrieving 
RNA and protein expression information from the Human Protein Atlas.

The repository also contains input and output files from various runs of the 
script, as well as other related information for the project. 

This script was written as part of the Caltech BMGF Non-Hormonal Contraceptives
research group in the Gradinaru lab. 

The files for the script are currently top level in the repository. 
Most subfolders have a "contents" file with a brief description of the files
contained. The python files should have internal documentation (assuming past
me had their act together), but I plan to add an overview here eventually.
