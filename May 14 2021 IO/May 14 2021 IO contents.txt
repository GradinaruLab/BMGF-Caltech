These are the input and output files from running the script on May 11th to
May 14th 2021. 

The data from Open Targets (EFO_0008560-associated-diseases.csv) and CITDB
(CITDBase-Target-Search.csv) were merged and associated with EnsIDs using the 
script. Then, a dozen or so targets where the script could not find an EnsID
were manually annotated. This merged dataset with EnsIDs was used to query the
Human Protein Atlas to retrieve the RNA and protein expression data. 

----


CITDBase-Target-Search.csv
    The full list of targets downloaded from CITDB on May 11th using the 
    following criteria:
        Sex:F:CTB	
        Consensus-RNAseq:Low	
        Proteomics-DB:Low	
        HPA-Ab:	
        Mouse Infertility	
        Druggable
    Contains 432 targets
    
EFO_0008560-associated-diseases.csv
    The full list of targets downloaded from Open Targets on May 11th. 
    Downloaded using the search for female infertility with 
    no filters selected. Contains 4228 targets. 
    
error_log.txt
    The file generated by the script to note errors returned by the 
    protein atlas server. Can use to figure out which EnsIDs had 404 errors. 
    Contains errors from multiple runs of the script, so will be repeats. 
    
full_target_list_RNA_and_Protein_corrected_2021-05-14_14-11-03.csv   
    The output from running the script (after it had been corrected to remove 
    false positives) on May 14th.

full_target_list_RNA_and_Protein_corrected_with-headers_2021-05-14_14-11-03.csv
    The output with a row of headers added to explain the source of the data
    in each column.
    
merged_OT_and_CITD_targets.csv
    Merged data from Open Targets and CITDB. A few missing EnsIDs were added
    manually to this file.
    
targets_without_ensID.csv
    The targets where the script did not find an EnsID.
    
targets_without_ensID_manually_annotated.csv
    The targets where the script did not find an EnsID, with the IDs added.
